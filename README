A smart Farming System using sensors and actuators


In IOT Smart Farming System, a system is built for monitoring the plants with the help of various sensors such as temperature, humidity, oxygen and soil moisture sensors.
These sensors help in the live monitoring of the plants and remote control at a very low cost.

This project is specifically designed for plant monitoring and greenhouse’s in people’s homes. The temperature and humidity sensors turn of fans and humidifiers respectively to keep their levels to a certain range. Through the plotting of values on
graphs, better analysis can be done, and future decisions can be taken based on these results. 

Our project aims to encourage more people to start their own greenhouse. 24/7 monitoring will no longer be required the use of these sensors and actuators which can be remotely controlled.
